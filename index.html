								<p>If you want to know about me, the best thing would be to meet face to face.</p>
								<p>BUT! Since you are already here, let me spill the beans...</p>
								<p>Hi, my name is Ethan and I have a very active imagination.
								I have a passion for telling stories and I try to bridge between my dreams to reality and to some degree between the technical to the artistic.</p>
								<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was intrigued with stories that my grandfather told me.
								From there, I started writing some of my own until I got my first computer. I realized that I can utilize software to help me visualize what I see in my head. My first introduction with such software was with 3D Studio for DOS.</p>
								<p>Let me pause here for a minute, I am not that old! Just mature.</p>
								<p>Anyway, where were we...</p>
								<p>Later on, I met Maya and ever since we were in love-and-hate relationship ; )
								I realized that if I can combine my imagination with an opportunity to "materialize" it via 3D software it would be "AWESOME!"
								Then, you add to the mix the amazing cinematic works of Blizzard and Pixar movies and you start realizing the power that such combination can give.</p>
								<p>Fast forward "a bit" and I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation and Visual Effects from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.
								There, I developed cravings to obtain even more knowledge. Not only about computer software but, physics, history etc.</p>
								<p>As a person I love multitasking and to engage in various activities.
								I also don't shy away from challenges and love to find direct or creative ways to solve difficult issues.
								I enjoy sharing my knowledge and convey the information to other people and collaborate with them about concepts and ideas - theoretical, philosophical and factual.</p>
								<p>One of the things that intrigues me the most about computer graphics is lighting and shading.
								At present, I am working on a short animation of a story I had playing in my mind ever since I was younger.
								Using Maya, RenderMan and other software I hope to be able to fulfill one of my biggest aspirations - to convey what's in my head to the screen so I can share it with others.</p>
								<p>If you managed to stay up until this line, thank you! I appreciate it!</p>
								<p>P.S.
								I do have other interests in life, but you're not here for that are you...?</p>
